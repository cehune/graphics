Note for whenever this goes public: This is a recording of exercises and programs made while self-studying computer graphics!
My goal is to follow the following resources for ray tracing and rendering (some not all)
- Samuel R. Buss' 3D Computer Graphics - A Mathematical Introduction with OpenGL
- Joey De Vries Learn OpenGL
- Shirley et al Ray Tracing in One Weekend series
- NVIDIA Ray Tracing Gems
- Shaders


In addition pursue the following
- GPU programming
- 3D reconstruction
- have fun :)
